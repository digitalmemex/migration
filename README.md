migration
=========

track and replay DeepaMehta plugin based TopicType modifications

The aim of the migration plugin is the migration of plugin based TopicType changes from one DeepaMehta instance to another. In other words we want to record all changes applied to one instance and to deploy the tracked modifications into another instance.
